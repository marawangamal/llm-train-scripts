# llm-train-scripts

Short simple language model training scripts using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. These scripts are intended to be used as a starting point for training language models on custom datasets.

## Scripts

- `train_clm_eli5.py`: Train a causal language model on the ELI5 dataset
- `train_clm_eli5_loop.py`: Train a causal language model on the ELI5 dataset with a explicit training loop
- `train_clm_eli5_char.py`: Train a causal language model on the ELI5 dataset with character-level tokenization
